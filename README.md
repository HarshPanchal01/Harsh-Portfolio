## Harsh Panchal · Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal portfolio site tailored for recruiters and engineering leaders. It showcases my site reliability, platform engineering, and data engineering experience.

### Tech Stack
- Static site powered by HTML5, modern CSS, and a touch of vanilla JavaScript.
- Responsive layout optimized for desktop and mobile, using the Montserrat typeface from Google Fonts.
- Sticky navigation, icon links, and smooth scroll affordances for a polished browsing experience.

### Local Development
1. Clone the repo and open the folder in your editor of choice.
2. Launch a simple static server to preview (for example, in VS Code run `npx serve` or enable the Live Server extension).
3. Edit `index.html`, `styles.css`, or `script.js` as needed. Changes are hot-reloaded by most dev servers.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Commit and push all changes to the `main` branch.
2. In the repository settings on GitHub, enable **Pages** and select `main` as the source with `/ (root)`.
3. Save—your site will publish at `https://harshpanchal01.github.io/Harsh-Portfolio/` within a couple of minutes.

### Customization Tips
- Drop your latest resume at `src/assets/Harsh-Panchal-Resume.pdf` so the hero button opens it in a new tab.
- Replace `src/assets/profile.jpg` with your own headshot; aim for a square image so the circular crop looks clean.
- Update project cards or experience entries directly in `src/index.html` to keep the content fresh.
- Update the company logo images in `src/assets/` to match the brands you showcase.
