## Harsh Panchal · Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal portfolio site tailored for recruiters and engineering leaders. It showcases my site reliability, platform engineering, and data engineering experience.

### Tech Stack
- Static site powered by HTML5, modern CSS, and a touch of vanilla JavaScript.
- Responsive layout optimized for desktop and mobile, using the Inter and JetBrains Mono font pairing.
- Scroll-triggered reveals and sticky navigation for a polished browsing experience.

### Local Development
1. Clone the repo and open the folder in your editor of choice.
2. Launch a simple static server to preview (for example, in VS Code run `npx serve` or enable the Live Server extension).
3. Edit `index.html`, `styles.css`, or `script.js` as needed. Changes are hot-reloaded by most dev servers.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Commit and push all changes to the `main` branch.
2. In the repository settings on GitHub, enable **Pages** and select `main` as the source with `/ (root)`.
3. Save—your site will publish at `https://harshpanchal01.github.io/Harsh-Portfolio/` within a couple of minutes.

### Customization Tips
- Replace the resume download URL in `index.html` once your latest PDF is in the repo.
- Update project cards or experience timeline by editing the relevant HTML sections.
- Add professional headshots or graphics by dropping assets into an `assets/` folder and referencing them in the markup.
