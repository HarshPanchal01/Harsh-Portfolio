## Portfolio Source Code

This repository contains the source code that powers **[harshpanchal.xyz](https://harshpanchal.xyz)**, my personal portfolio. The site showcases my experience across site reliability, platform engineering, data systems, and the projects Iâ€™m most proud of.

Key elements featured on the live site:
- resume download, social links, and a personal introduction.
- Experience timeline covering all my roles.
- Highlighted my favourite projects.
- Contact form routed through FormSubmit.

The codebase is intentionally lightweight with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which keeps the site fast and easy to maintain.
