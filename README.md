## Portfolio Source Code

This repository contains the source code that powers **[harshpanchal.xyz](https://harshpanchal.xyz)**, my personal portfolio. The site showcases my experience across site reliability, platform engineering, data systems, and the projects I’m most proud of.

Key elements featured on the live site:
- resume download, social links, and a personal introduction.
- Experience timeline covering all my roles.
- Highlighted my favourite projects.
- Contact form routed through FormSubmit.

The codebase is intentionally lightweight with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which keeps the site fast and easy to maintain.

Want to remake this after this sem with a new idea. OS themed for all, Mac, Windows, Ubuntu Mint, Arch.
